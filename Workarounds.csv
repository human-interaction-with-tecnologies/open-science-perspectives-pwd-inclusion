A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"e. For example, {P9} described having “weekly meetings with my boss [because] I don’t know much of anything about [this API]...because he knows a lot more [about it] than I do.” {P3} used others as information sources to find mathematical information specific to the scientific field in which his application was being used. {P7} used designers working on his team to find information specific to their job role, including “how the different flows work...and the reasoning behind it.”",Non-Impaired Help
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"But, our findings suggest that whether employing the vision of sighted colleagues as a workaround was perceived by DWVI as an embarrassing act of reliance or a typical team collaboration depended upon the knowledge and empathy of their sighted teammate",Non-Impaired Help
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"Notably, participants described several unique strategies for working around accessibility barriers arising during information seeking in development. Five participants {P1, P3, P6, P7, P8} described sharing and receiving information specifc to accessibility in development from other DWVI, who they knew personally {P1, P8} or contacted through DWVI mailing lists",Sharing Among Impaired Professionals
A3,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"Additionally, five participants {P1, P3, P4, P6, P8} used custom accessibility setups which they developed themselves {P3, P4, P8} or had been developed by personal contacts who are also DWVI {P1, P6, P8}",Develop their own solutions
A13,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"For learning how to control the coding environments (e.g., git/GitHub, VSCode), Seo compared his experiences of navigating GUI features with screen readers and CLI workarounds. He noted, “I like to use CLI instead of GUI because typing commands and getting results are much quicker than navigating GUI elements. Of course, the learning curve is steep for CLI since I have to learn and memorize each command. Usually, I make my own command-line cheatsheets for each software I use.” ",Adapt work dinamics
A61,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"They also note the lack of development tool usage by DWVI - most of them used text editors instead of IDEs, printf debugging instead of debuggers, used temporary text bufers for editing code outside the IDE, and preferred languages like Python primarily due to the availability of the interpreter",Tool Exchange or Special Configuration

A61,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,workarounds : The workarounds participants use for man pages were diverse depending on their background.

A147,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"For example, syntax highlighting, code autocompletion and autosuggestion, diagnostics and linting, variable watches and breakpoints are underutilized even among experiencedBlind and/or Visual Impaired programmers, and manyBlind and/or Visual Impaired developers are still working manually with simple text like Notepad, along with runtime and compile terminals [1, 2, 9].",Tool Exchange or Special Configuration

A312,Blind and/or Visual Impaired,"Although most participants (n = 16) tended to avoid seeking help from sighted co-workers, others (n = 10) found it necessary. For example, P25 seeks sighted help to get an overview of the entire codebase when a new implementation takes place. This helps reduce the amount of time a blind programmer takes to get an overview of the entire implementation. P7 agreed that requesting sighted help is understandable since blind programmers are unable to simply glance at codebase due to the linear nature of the screen reader: “Reviewing another programmer’s code with a screen reader takes longer than someone who is not blind, I seek help sometimes  to get [a] quick overview of the new implementation.” (P7)",Non-Impaired Help
